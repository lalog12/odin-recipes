        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe was given to us from a family friend named Grandma Jiji. Our family has had the recipe
            for the last 20 years and we follow it every time we want chocolate chip cookies. The cookies taste
            great and I think that they are healthier than the cookies that are sold at fast food restaurants or
            at the store. Enjoy the recipe!
